    <description>Version 6
The BetterRimworlds Dematerializer enables you to dematerialize materials and pawns (both friendly and hostile!) from
anywhere on the map into a temporary subspace bubble that will persist as long as their is a persistent flow of energy
to the subspace capacitors.

**ALERT: The Dematerializer has *harsh* consequences for all higher lifeforms on the map in the case of power failure!**
